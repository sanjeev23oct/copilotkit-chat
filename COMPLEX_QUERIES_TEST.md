# Complex Database Queries - Test Suite

## üéØ Setup Complex Database

Run this command to set up a realistic e-commerce database:

```bash
cd backend
npm run setup-complex-db
```

This creates:
- **10 tables**: suppliers, categories, products, customers, addresses, orders, order_items, reviews, payments, shipping, inventory
- **20+ products** across multiple categories
- **10 customers** with addresses
- **10 orders** with items
- **10 reviews**
- **Multiple relationships** and foreign keys
- **Views** for common queries
- **Indexes** for performance

## üéØ Testing Workflow

### 1. Setup Database
```bash
cd backend
npm run setup-complex-db
```

### 2. Start Backend
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Queries

**Simple Test:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3010/api/postgres-agent/nl-query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is the total revenue from all orders?"}'
```

**Complex Test:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3010/api/postgres-agent/nl-query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Show me the top 5 customers by total spending with their order counts"}'
```

### 4. Compare Models

Test the same query with different models:

**8B Model:**
```env
LLM_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant
```

**70B Model:**
```env
LLM_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
```

**DeepSeek:**
```env
LLM_PROVIDER=deepseek
LLM_MODEL=deepseek-chat
```

---

## üìä Evaluation Criteria

For each query, evaluate:

1. **SQL Correctness** - Does it generate valid SQL?
2. **Query Accuracy** - Does it answer the question?
3. **Performance** - Are JOINs and indexes used properly?
4. **Completeness** - Are all required fields included?
5. **Optimization** - Is the query efficient?

## üöÄ Quick Test Script

Save this as `test-complex-queries.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

QUERIES=(
  "What is the total revenue from all orders?"
  "Who are the top 5 customers by total spending?"
  "Show me products with their average ratings"
  "What is the total revenue for each product category?"
  "Show me customers who have spent more than 1000 dollars"
)

for query in "${QUERIES[@]}"; do
  echo "Testing: $query"
  curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3010/api/postgres-agent/nl-query \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"query\": \"$query\"}" | jq '.sql, .confidence, .model'
  echo "---"
done
```
