# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a professional AI Chat application that enables natural language conversations with various LLM models. The application will feature a React + Vite frontend with CopilotKit integration, a Node.js backend, database connectivity for context-aware responses, and a generic LLM adapter system supporting multiple AI providers including DeepSeek and local models. The system will implement AG-UI protocol for enhanced user interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have natural language conversations with AI models through a professional chat interface, so that I can get intelligent responses to my queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a clean, professional chat interface
2. WHEN a user types a message and presses enter THEN the system SHALL send the message to the AI model and display the response
3. WHEN the AI is processing a request THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
4. WHEN a conversation is active THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation history in the UI
5. IF the AI model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to access and query database information in response to my natural language prompts, so that I can get data-driven answers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question requiring database information THEN the system SHALL query the relevant database tables
2. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL return results in natural language format
3. IF a database query fails THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest alternative approaches
4. WHEN multiple database records are found THEN the system SHALL present the information in a structured, readable format
5. WHEN no relevant data is found THEN the system SHALL inform the user clearly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure different LLM providers (DeepSeek, local models, etc.) through environment variables, so that I can switch between AI models by updating the .env file without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring an LLM provider THEN the system SHALL read provider-specific connection parameters from environment variables
2. WHEN switching between LLM providers THEN the system SHALL maintain the same chat interface and functionality after restart
3. WHEN a local LLM is configured via .env THEN the system SHALL connect to local model endpoints
4. WHEN DeepSeek or other cloud providers are configured via .env THEN the system SHALL handle API authentication securely
5. WHEN environment variables are updated THEN the system SHALL use the new configuration after restart

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to implement CopilotKit integration, so that users can benefit from enhanced AI-assisted interactions and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CopilotKit is integrated THEN the system SHALL provide enhanced chat capabilities beyond basic text exchange
2. WHEN users interact with the interface THEN CopilotKit SHALL provide contextual assistance and suggestions
3. WHEN complex workflows are initiated THEN CopilotKit SHALL guide users through multi-step processes
4. WHEN the application loads THEN CopilotKit components SHALL be properly initialized and functional

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to implement AG-UI protocol, so that I can have more interactive and dynamic conversations with the AI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AG-UI protocol is active THEN the system SHALL support rich interactive elements in chat responses
2. WHEN the AI suggests actions THEN the system SHALL present them as clickable UI elements
3. WHEN users interact with AG-UI elements THEN the system SHALL execute the corresponding actions
4. WHEN complex data is presented THEN the system SHALL use appropriate AG-UI components for better visualization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my conversation history to be persisted, so that I can continue previous conversations and reference past interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a new session THEN the system SHALL load previous conversation history
2. WHEN conversations are saved THEN the system SHALL store both user messages and AI responses
3. WHEN users search conversation history THEN the system SHALL provide relevant results
4. WHEN conversation data is stored THEN the system SHALL ensure user privacy and data security
5. IF storage fails THEN the system SHALL continue functioning with session-only memory

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to provide RESTful APIs for chat functionality, so that the frontend can communicate effectively with the AI services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend sends a chat message THEN the backend SHALL process it through the configured LLM
2. WHEN database queries are needed THEN the backend SHALL execute them and include results in the AI context
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN the backend SHALL validate input and handle errors gracefully
4. WHEN responses are sent THEN the backend SHALL format them appropriately for frontend consumption
5. WHEN authentication is required THEN the backend SHALL verify user permissions before processing requests

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and monitoring, so that it can be deployed reliably in professional environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL include health check endpoints
3. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring metrics
4. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate them before applying
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully without exposing sensitive information
